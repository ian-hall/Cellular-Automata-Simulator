This is Ian's Automata Whatever's Readme

This is a console program that allows you to choose between 1D and 2D cellular automata to run simulations of. For both types,
users are able to choose the rule set and initial population to use. For 2D automata, users can choose to build their own initial pop,
choose a preloaded population from a list, or load a CELLS file consiting of '.'s and 'O's representing cells.
